## Introduction
The basic task of a Bayesian network is to compute the posterior probability distributions for a set of query variables,given an observation of a set of evidence variables. This process is known as inference, but is also called Bayesian updating, belief updating or reasoning. This process is known as inference, but is also called Bayesian updating, belief updating or reasoning. There are two ways to approach this, either exact or approximate. Both approaches are worst-case NP-hard. An exact method obviously gives an exact result, while an approximate method tries to approach the correct outcome as close as possible. [[1]](###1)
